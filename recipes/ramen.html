<h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Making ramen from scratch is pretty darn elaborate. It can be a multiday affair, and if you simply don’t have time for it, it can seem very intimidating. (No, we’re not making our own noodles this time around...Im taking it easy on you for now.) Our shoyu ramen recipe calls for making four important components: dashi and tare for the soup base, and nitamago and chashu as showstopping toppings. You can certainly eat a decent bowl of noodles without one or two of these players, but man oh man, magic happens when they all come together in one bite. Fear not: Your patience will be rewarded.

        When you want to cook to impress, few dishes can top homemade ramen. This recipe makes enough broth and toppings for 4 servings and keeps well in the fridge for a week, so if you're cooking for one, it's the perfect thing to make on a Sunday and heat up throughout the week.
